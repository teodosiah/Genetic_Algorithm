# Genetic_Algorithm
C# algorithm based on [Genetic Algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm)

Problem description:

In the computer game, the character has collected 5000 coins. He falls into a cave where he meets an artifact merchant. 
The merchant sells N a number of different artifacts (magic bow for precision shooting, fast boots, etc). 
Each artifact has a price in gold and a value of how important it is to the character. 
The algorithm has to find the items the hero needs to buy according to the table below:
